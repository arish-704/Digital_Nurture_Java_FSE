Git Ignore:
.gitignore is a special file in Git that tells Git which files or folders it should ignore while tracking changes. This means the files listed in .gitignore will not be tracked, committed, or pushed to any remote repository like GitHub. It is mainly used to prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being uploaded to the repository. Examples include temporary files created by editors, log files, build output files like target/ or dist/, and secret files such as .env containing passwords or API keys. Using .gitignore keeps the repository clean and secure by including only the files that are actually needed for the project.

How to Ignore Unwanted Files Using Git Ignore:
To ignore unwanted files in Git, create a file named .gitignore in the root folder of your project. In this file, list the names or patterns of the files and folders you want Git to ignore. For example, writing *.log will ignore all files ending with .log, target/ will ignore the build folder, and .env will ignore the environment file. Once the .gitignore file is saved, add and commit it using git add .gitignore and git commit -m "Added gitignore file". Keep in mind that .gitignore only affects new files. If a file is already tracked by Git, you need to untrack it first using git rm --cached filename before it will be ignored.

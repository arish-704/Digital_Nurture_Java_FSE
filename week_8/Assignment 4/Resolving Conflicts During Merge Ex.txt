Resolving Conflicts During Merge Explanation:
A merge conflict happens in Git when changes in two branches affect the same part of the same file, and Git cannot automatically decide which change to keep. To resolve a merge conflict, first run the merge command (e.g., git merge branch-name) and Git will show the files that have conflicts. Open the conflicted file, and you will see special markers like <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> showing the different changes from both branches. You need to carefully read these changes, decide which parts to keep, and then edit the file to remove the conflict markers. After fixing all conflicts, save the file, stage it using git add filename, and then commit the merge using git commit. This finalizes the merge with the resolved changes. The key is to understand both versions of the conflicting code and choose the correct or combined solution before completing the merge.
